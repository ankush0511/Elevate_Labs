## 🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates how to handle real-world, messy datasets by applying:

- Handling **missing values**
- Removing **duplicate records**
- Fixing **inconsistent data formats** (e.g., Date/Time)
- **Outlier detection and treatment**
- **Standardizing** numerical data
- Performing **data quality checks**

The notebook is designed for anyone who wants to understand the essential "data cleaning" phase before model-building or analysis.

## 🧹 Key Concepts Covered

1. **Missing Values**  
   Strategies like removing (`dropna()`) or filling (`fillna()`) gaps in data.

2. **Duplicate Records**  
   Identifying and removing repeated rows to avoid bias.

3. **Inconsistent Formats**  
   Cleaning and converting formats such as date/time using `pandas.to_datetime()`.

4. **Outlier Treatment**  
   Detecting extreme values and applying methods to handle them — like capping, transforming, or removal.

5. **Data Standardization**  
   Scaling data using z-scores for fair and balanced modeling.

6. **Data Quality Checks**  
   Using summary statistics, visual inspections, and Pandas utilities to ensure clean and trustworthy datasets.
