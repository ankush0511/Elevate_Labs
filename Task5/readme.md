# 🗂️ Data Analysis Project

## 📖 Project Overview
This project involves detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a given dataset, including:
- Handling missing data
- Feature engineering
- Data visualization
- Model building (basic regression and tree-based models)

The goal is to prepare the dataset for robust modeling and understand the underlying data patterns.

## 📂 Repository Structure
```bash
.
├── Data_Analysis.ipynb    # Main Jupyter Notebook containing all analysis
├── README.md              # Project documentation
├── data/                  # Folder for input datasets (add your files here)
├── outputs/               # Folder to save plots, models, and results
```

---

## ⚙️ Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-repo-name>
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *(Note: If `requirements.txt` is not available, typical packages used are `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`.)*

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Data_Analysis.ipynb
   ```
2. Run each cell sequentially to reproduce the results.

## 📊 Key Methods Used
- Pandas for data wrangling
- Seaborn & Matplotlib for visualization
- Scikit-learn for modeling and preprocessing
- Missing value handling and outlier detection
- Basic feature engineering

---

## 🧠 Future Work
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Use advanced models like XGBoost, LightGBM
- Perform feature selection to improve model accuracy
- Create a pipeline for automated data preprocessing
